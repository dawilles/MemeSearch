## 🛠 Built With

- **GIPHY API**: Integrated for meme fetching. 

- **React**: The backbone of the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking.
- **Material-UI**: For a responsive and intuitive UI.

## 🌈 Features

- **Dynamic Themes**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Form Handling**: Leveraged `Formik` for streamlined form validation.

## 🎓 Good Practices

- **Modular Code**: Components are isolated for easier debugging and testing.
- **Custom Hooks**: Utilized for better reusability (`useColorMode`, `useReloadableData`).
- **State Management**: Properly managed different states for data (`not_requested`, `loading`, `loaded`, `error`).

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Practical experience with React and its ecosystem.
- Advanced form handling using Formik.
- How to design for UX, including error and loading states.
- Learning to work with APIs was an invaluable experience.
